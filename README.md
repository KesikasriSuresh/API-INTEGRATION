**Description**

Description:
This project involved developing a responsive webpage that fetches and displays real-time data from a public API. I selected the OpenWeather API to retrieve current weather information based on user input. The webpage dynamically loads and updates the weather data, providing a seamless and interactive user experience.
The interface was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring compatibility across different devices and screen sizes. To enhance the design, Canva was used for creating visually appealing UI components.
