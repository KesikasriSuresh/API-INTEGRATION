**Description**

This project's objective was to create an interactive, responsive webpage that retrieves and presents data from a public API. I decided to use the OpenWeather API to incorporate real-time weather data for this task. Based on the user's input, the webpage dynamically loads the weather data and presents it in an understandable and aesthetically pleasing manner.
I used contemporary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript techniques to guarantee responsiveness and a seamless user experience across devices. Canva was used to add visual elements to the layout and design.
